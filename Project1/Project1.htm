<h2>Website 1 Critique - Trader Joe's</h2>
<p>www.traderjoes.com</p> 

<ol>
<li>My first impression is good, I like the aesthetic, it is in accordance with the brand and has a simple layout.</li>
<li>The main page has featured items, receipes and events.
    The page feels simple enough that I can find anything I need, but not boring. <br> 
    It has a scrolling feature so there are the lists with the most relevant information,<br> 
    and nagivation bars at the top for other more specific things a customer may be looking for.<br> 
    The features lower on the page seem a little random, but the aesthetic is good and the information all makes sense.</li> 
<li>The structure makes sense, it flows well and I am able to navigate it intuitively.<br> 
    There are tabs at the top for some common things people would want to view on their site (like career opportunities, announcements, stores etc.).<br>  
    And there is a hamburger menu to the left with more links to current grocery items and lots of other information.</li> 
<li>The graphics are nice, with little ilustrations in thier brand's style, designed border around the images at the top, and pictures of their food.<br> 
    The images look like they were kind of randomly taken (not in a studio for advertising food, it looks like a phone just took it) <br> 
    which is a bit odd, but it could be stylistic to their homey vibe.</li>
<li>The page loaded almost immediately, it was very reasonable and the nagivation is fast as well.</li>   
<li>The text sizing is good for the titles at the top, but lower down they are kind of small and it gives the site <br> 
    a strange flow (it starts to just feel like a lot of lists).<br> 
    Having an image at the top enhances the site, but the choice of image could have been better.<br> 
    There is a background color for the top section, which is a nice addition. I wish they had more background colors down the page,<br> 
    the rest of the page is mostly a white background which leaves the page feeling a little cheap or unprofessional.</li> 
<li>The tabs at the top are very simplistic, and the hamburger menu on the left is really useful. It is easy to naviagte but could be more stylistic.<br>  
    I find the lists below the introduction of the page to be a little random, those could've just been in the tabs under "Announcements" or "Events"<br> 
    The hamburger menu has a lot of options for a small grocery store like Trader Joes, but I think they are all nice. <br>
    I would've combined some of the options to make it less chaotic.</li> 
<li>The main page holds to the color scheme of Trader Joe's as a brand very well, but the links to the grocery items ended up falling flat.<br> 
    They are mainly just a white background with plain text (but a matching font), and pictures of their food. <br> 
    It was very plain- which seems kind of strange since thier groceries are why people know Trader Joe's as a brand.<br> 
    They could have included more of their signature Trader Joe's Red color scheme with the black illustration-style pictures all around the page.<br> 
    I do think the left panel has some nice filters and tags with a nice peachy brown color that suits their style. <br> 
    Overall it looks really nice and keept to the Trader Joe's simplistic, quirky, style.</li> 
<li>The site needs to be full sized to see a lot of the style, or the left banner with "recipes" and other options relating to the groceries, on the grocery pages. <br> 
    The page adjusts slightly to a smaller window, but it does lose functionality because you must scroll around a lot to find the options for filtering.</li> 
<li>This site offers a lot of interaction with their products (recipes, ways to pair them etc.) and events and things that I didn't know this store even had. <br> 
    I like that this page has a lot of extra features, and that it is really naviagable. <br> 
    They sacrificed some of the easy functionality for having more information on their site that some may find unecessary, but I think it was worthwhile.<br> 
    Most people who visit a Trader Joe's site are likely looking for recipes, checking the current products, or events because they love the brand,<br> 
    those who won't appreciate these additions are likely not checking the site anyways and just shop in person.<br> 
    They know their audience and offer a Trader Joe's culture through their website.</li>
